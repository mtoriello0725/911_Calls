# 911_Calls
This is a project assigned in the Udemy course "Python for Data Science".  The goal of this project is to practice using Pandas dataframes, along with matplotlib and seaborn diagrams to manipulate and present a database of 911 calls collected. 
This project is regularly performed in the Jupyter Notebook template provided by the course, but I wanted to process and present the project as if it was to be implemented in a professional setting.
